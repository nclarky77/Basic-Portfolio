       <p>Favorite food and why: My favorite food is a boiled lobster. This is the dinner that my family prepares for every birthday. It reminds me of all the members of my family and how much fun I have when we are all together.</p> 
        <p>What kind of tree would you be and why: I would be a beech tree. Not only are they tall and nice to look at, they also provide lumber that primarily is used to make chairs and stools. I am a person people like to rely on, like to “lean on.”</p>
        <p>Favorite Novel and why: I am not an avid reader of fiction works, but I am quite partial to The Fall by Albert Camus. Philosophical writing intrigues me.</p>
        <p>Favorite cartoon character and why: Mickey Mouse is easily my favorite cartoon character. To me he stands for a man and many ideas that fascinate. Disney is a favorite topic of mine. Whether reading, discussing, or watching.</p>
        <p>Favorite movie and why: Toy Story is my favorite movie. I have a special connection to it seeing as we both were “released” in the same month, November of 1995. PIXAR has always provided me comfort. It is a movie I will always love to watch.
